# Valentine's Day ML Lesson: Tarzan AI Learns What Flower Jane Likes 

<b>Background</b>: 
In the Korean TV series - Start-Up, a young entrepreneur, Do-San uses an analogy of Tarzan and Jane to explain how machine learning works. Watch the clip [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDiCGa1xtrQ/)
MD.ai wants to help Tarzan AI learn Jane's favortite flower, roses or tulips? In this example, we assume Jane only likes tulips. To train Tarzan AI, we annotated some example images of these two flowers as "Jane Likes ‚ù§Ô∏è" or "Jane Dislikes üòî" on MD.ai Annotator. This project contain 3 datasets, "train", "validation", and "test", and we'll see if Tarzan AI will learn to predict Jane's favorite flower using the test dataset.
Check out the [project](https://public.md.ai/annotator/project/nxN1d4R6/workspace) on MD.ai. You can `clone` the project, try to annotate yourself, and see if you can classify flowers better than Tarzan ü§ì.
